## Overview

Rubix Network supports a lightweight and secure Decentralized Identity (DID) mechanism built using the **BIP39 standard**. This implementation allows users and systems to generate cryptographic identities that are:

- **Self-owned** and **recoverable**
- **Verifiable** through cryptographic proofs
- **Tamper-proof** with on-chain claim registration
- **Privacy-preserving**, with optional selective disclosure

This guide covers the concepts behind DID, its significance, and how to create, register, and recover a BIP39-based DID on the Rubix Network.

## What is a DID?

A **Decentralized Identifier (DID)** is a cryptographic, globally unique identifier that enables the creation of **self-sovereign identities**. Unlike centralized identities tied to usernames or email addresses, a DID:

- Is **generated by the user** (not issued)
- **Eliminates third-party trust dependencies**
- Enables **verifiable claims** without disclosing sensitive data

---

## Why BIP39-Based DID?

Rubix supports multiple DID types, but the recommended and default approach is **BIP39-based DID (Type 4)**. It offers:

- 24-word **mnemonic-based** identity recovery
- Secure **key pair generation** using `secp256k1` elliptic curve
- Compatibility with **Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet (HD Wallet)** specs
- No external Certificate Authorities (CA) required

---

## Verifiable Claims in Rubix

Verifiable claims allow identity holders to present cryptographically signed statements (e.g., “User1 graduated from XYZ University”) without relying on centralized servers.

- Claims are **100% on-chain**
- Can be selectively disclosed and verified
- Tamper-proof and immutable
- Aligned with **W3C Verifiable Credentials** and **Linked Data Signatures**

## DID Creation & Registration Workflow

### 1. Start Rubix Node

Ensure your Rubix node is up and running on a port (e.g., `20000`):

```bash
./rubixgoplatform startnode -port <port_number>
```

---

### 2. Create a DID Using BIP39

Open a new terminal tab in the same build directory and run:

```bash
./rubixgoplatform createdid -didType 4 -port <port_number>
```

**Example:**

```bash
./rubixgoplatform createdid -didType 4 -port <port_number>
```

> This command:
> - Generates a 24-word mnemonic (`mnemonic.txt`)
> - Derives a secure key pair
> - Outputs a unique DID identifier

---

### 3. Backup Mnemonic

After DID creation, navigate to the folder:

```bash
cd <path_to_node>/Rubix/TestNetDID/<did_generated>
```

Copy and store the `mnemonic.txt` file in a secure offline location.  
This file is essential for identity recovery.

---

### 4. Register the DID

Once the DID is created, register it on the Rubix network:

```bash
./rubixgoplatform registerdid -did <your_did> -port <port_number>
```

**Example:**

```bash
./rubixgoplatform registerdid -did bafybmicfvpln2j5yfjeokmafjsefz7ykibvtsg2swxmnr6nhvflj6qvo34 -port <port_number>
```

---

### 5. Recover the DID (If Needed)

To recover a lost DID using the mnemonic:

```bash
./rubixgoplatform createdid -didType 4 -mnemonicKeyFile /path/to/mnemonic.txt -port <port_number>
```

This regenerates the same DID and key pair.

## Summary of Commands

| Task             | Command Example |
|------------------|------------------|
| Start Node       | `./rubixgoplatform startnode -port <port>` |
| Create DID       | `./rubixgoplatform createdid -didType 4 -port <port>` |
| Register DID     | `./rubixgoplatform registerdid -did <your_did> -port <port>` |

## Standards Compliance

Rubix DID implementation is aligned with:

- W3C Verifiable Credentials
- W3C Linked Data Signatures
- IMS Open Badges
- GDPR & CCPA regulations

---

## Closing Thoughts

The BIP39-based DID on Rubix is a **privacy-first**, **developer-friendly**, and **production-ready** identity primitive. It aligns with the principles of self-sovereignty, transparency, and decentralization empowering developers to build trust into the very fabric of their applications.
