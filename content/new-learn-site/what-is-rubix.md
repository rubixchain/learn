## What is Rubix?

Rubix is a layer-1 blockchain designed to address the scale, cost, and privacy shortcomings of blockchain protocols that rely on one sequentially organized chain (monolithic) of all global transactions. The protocol divides the global state machine into a large, but finite number of state-machines called Tokenchains. While each Tokenchain maintains one state, together all Tokenchains represent a globally accessible singleton state that is immutable.

## Why Rubix?

Rubix stands out due to its strong focus on decentralization and scalability. Its parallel chain architecture allows Rubix Tokenchain to process transactions asynchronously and in parallel, unlike traditional blockchains that handle transactions sequentially. This means each transaction achieves finality independently without waiting for unrelated transactions, enabling significant scalability.

On decentralization, Rubix ensures that every node has an equal chance to become a validator through a decentralized selection mechanism. Unlike conventional Proof of Work or Proof of Stake systems, which rely on concentrated hash power or large stakes, Rubix requires all validators to stake equal amounts, giving each validator an equal probability of selection. This approach promotes fairness and energy efficiency while maintaining security.
