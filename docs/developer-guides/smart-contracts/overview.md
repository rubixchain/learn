# Smart Contract Overview

Smart contracts are like automated, trustworthy agreements written in code. They run on a blockchain, which is a secure, shared digital record. These contracts automatically follow their rules when certain conditions are met, without needing a middleman.

At Rubix, we think of smart contracts as special digital items (like unique collectibles called NFTs) that can change and keep track of their state. Every time you use a smart contract, it updates its state, and this update is saved on a special chain called the Contract Token Chain. This chain acts like a permanent, unchangeable record, so everyone can see and trust what happened.

To ensure versatility and adaptability, Rubix smart contracts are crafted in prevalent web2 languages, including Rust, JavaScript, and GoLang. These contracts are subsequently executed within a WebAssembly (WASM) environment. Rubix's architecture is strategically designed to foster enhanced adoption rates, and our choice to employ widely-recognized web2 languages significantly amplifies this objective.
