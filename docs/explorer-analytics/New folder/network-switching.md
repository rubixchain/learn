# Switching Between Networks

Toggle between Rubix Mainnet and Testnet environments.

## Network Options

### Mainnet
- **Production environment** with real RBT tokens
- Live economic data and actual validator stakes
- Permanent, immutable transaction records
- Real financial value at risk

### Testnet  
- **Development environment** with test tokens
- Safe experimentation without financial risk
- Same features as mainnet for testing
- Free test tokens available

## How to Switch

1. **Find Network Toggle**: Located in explorer header
2. **Select Network**: Click Mainnet or Testnet
3. **Auto-Refresh**: Data loads for selected network
4. **Verify Selection**: Check visual indicators

## Visual Indicators

- **Network Label**: Clear "Mainnet" or "Testnet" display
- **Color Coding**: Different color schemes for each network
- **URL Changes**: Network selection reflected in URL

## Development Workflow

1. **Test on Testnet**: Develop and test applications safely
2. **Verify Functionality**: Ensure all features work correctly  
3. **Deploy to Mainnet**: Move to production environment
4. **Monitor Both**: Use both networks for ongoing development

## Important Notes

- Networks have **separate data** - transactions don't cross over
- Search results are **network-specific**
- Bookmarks should specify which network
- Always verify you're on the intended network before transactions

For development, always start with Testnet to avoid costs and risks.
