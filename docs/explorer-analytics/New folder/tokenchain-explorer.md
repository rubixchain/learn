# Tokenchain Explorer

Unique to Rubix's sharded architecture, the Tokenchain Explorer allows you to view the immutable history of any token. This feature provides complete transparency into a token's journey from creation to its current state, offering insights unavailable in traditional blockchain explorers.

## Understanding Tokenchains

In Rubix's maximally sharded architecture, each token maintains its own history chain. This design enables:
- **Complete Token Traceability**: Track every transaction involving a specific token
- **Immutable History**: View the entire lifecycle of any token
- **Ownership Verification**: Confirm current and historical ownership
- **Creation Details**: Access information about token genesis

## Searching by Token ID

### How to Search
1. **Enter Token ID**: Input the unique token identifier in the search bar
2. **Access Token History**: View the dedicated tokenchain page
3. **Explore Timeline**: Navigate through the token's complete history

### Token Information Available

**Current Token State**
- Current owner's DID (Decentralized Identifier)
- Token's present location in the network
- Latest transaction involving the token
- Current token status and properties

**Historical Data**
- **Creation Record**: When and how the token was first minted
- **Ownership Chain**: Complete list of all previous owners
- **Transaction History**: Every transaction that moved or affected the token
- **Validation Records**: Quorum signatures for each ownership transfer

## Token History Timeline

The tokenchain displays information in chronological order:

**Genesis Block**
- Token creation transaction
- Initial minting details
- First owner assignment
- Creation timestamp

**Ownership Transfers**
- Sequential list of all ownership changes
- Transaction IDs for each transfer
- Validator signatures confirming each transfer
- Timestamps for all movements

**Current Status**
- Present owner information
- Latest transaction details
- Token's current network location
- Active status verification

## Use Cases for Tokenchain Explorer

**Ownership Verification**
- Verify legitimate ownership of digital assets
- Check for any disputed ownership claims
- Confirm token authenticity and provenance

**Asset Tracking**
- Track valuable digital assets through their lifecycle
- Monitor token movements for compliance purposes
- Investigate token history for due diligence

**Fraud Prevention**
- Identify suspicious ownership patterns
- Verify token legitimacy before transactions
- Detect potential counterfeit or duplicate tokens

## Benefits of Sharded Token History

Unlike traditional blockchain explorers that show transactions across all assets, Rubix's tokenchain explorer provides:
- **Focused History**: See only transactions relevant to a specific token
- **Granular Insights**: Detailed information about each token's unique journey
- **Efficient Lookup**: Faster searches focused on individual token histories
- **Complete Transparency**: Full visibility into any token's entire lifecycle
