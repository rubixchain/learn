# DID Chain & Identity Insights

DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) are the identity layer of Rubix, each maintaining its own chain.  

To explore a DID, select **DID Explorer** in the menu and enter the DID ID.  
The result shows:  
- DID address & metadata  
- Public keys and updates  
- On-chain history, including token creation and transactions  

This allows full transparency of identity activities without compromising privacy.
