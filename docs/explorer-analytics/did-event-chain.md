# DID Event Chain Viewer

The DID Event Chain explorer surfaces the complete lifecycle of any decentralized identity. Start by viewing the DID’s profile information: public keys, peer IDs, and creation metadata. Scroll through the activity timeline to see every transaction, contract execution, or subnet registration associated with that DID. Monitor key rotation and authorization events to audit security posture over time. Use relationship mapping to visualize connections between DIDs, tokens, and contracts, helping you assess trust boundaries and permission scopes in your application.

- Identity Profile: Display DID address, peer ID, creation metadata, and public keys.
- Activity Timeline: Chronologically list all transactions, contract calls, and subnet registrations.
- Key Rotation & Authorization: Track public key updates and permission grants or revocations.
- Relationship Mapping: Visualize connections to other DIDs, contracts, and tokens.
