# Rubix Explorer Walkthrough

The Rubix Explorer is your public gateway to the decentralized Rubix Mainnet and Testnet. It provides a transparent, real-time window into all on-chain activity. Unlike explorers for monolithic blockchains, which are structured around linear block histories, the Rubix Explorer is uniquely designed to reflect the network's maximally sharded architecture, offering deeper, more granular insights.

The mainnet explorer provides a high-level snapshot of the network's health and economic activity, including key metrics for the native RBT token like its price and trading volume. At a more granular level, the explorer provides detailed data and robust search capabilities for specific on-chain entities.

The explorer is your guide to the network’s on-chain activity through several key features:

Transaction Explorer: Trace the full lifecycle of any transaction. A dedicated page for each Transaction ID (TXID) provides a transparent record of the entire validation process, displaying the sender and receiver's Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and the cryptographic signatures of validating quorum members. This serves as a clear audit trail for every transaction.

Tokenchain Explorer: Unique to Rubix's sharded architecture, this feature allows you to view the immutable history of a single token. By searching for a specific Token ID, you can access a complete list of every transaction involving that token.

DID Explorer: As the fundamental identity primitive on the Rubix network, each DID has a detailed profile. Search for a DID to view its unique address, a hash of its creation image file, and associated public keys. The page also lists the DID's complete on-chain history.

## Testnet

In contrast to the mainnet, the Rubix Testnet Explorer is a purpose-built sandbox for developers. It provides a risk-free environment for testing smart contracts and dApps with features like a testnet faucet for free test tokens.

## How to Use the Explorer

A quick-reference guide to the explorer interfaces:

- Environment Toggle: Switch instantly between mainnet and testnet contexts.
- Global Search: Query by transaction hash, DID, token ID, or subnet ID.
- Dashboard Panels: Access quick links to blocks, transactions, DIDs, tokens, subnets, and wallets.
