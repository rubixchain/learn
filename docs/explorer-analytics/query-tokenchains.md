# Querying Tokenchains

The **TokenChain Explorer** is your tool for tracing a token’s complete lifecycle on the Rubix blockchain. Unlike traditional blockchains where all tokens share a single ledger, Rubix assigns **a dedicated TokenChain to every token**, enabling fine-grained, auditable histories.

## Key Capabilities

- **Token Lineage**  
  Retrieve the full immutable record of a token, including its genesis transaction, transfers, pledges, and contract interactions.  

- **Ownership Timeline**  
  View the chronological list of wallet DIDs that have held the token, ensuring accountability at every step.  

- **Contract Interactions**  
  Inspect how and when the token was pledged to or released from smart contracts.  

- **Auditable Trail**  
  Every event is cryptographically signed and timestamped for reproducibility.  

## How to Use

1. Go to the **Explorer homepage**.  
2. Use the **Global Search bar** to enter a **Token ID**.  
3. Navigate to the **Token Details page** for that ID.  
4. Explore the **Transaction List** to see every event tied to that token.
