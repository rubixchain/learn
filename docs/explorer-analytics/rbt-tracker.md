# RBT Credit Tracker

The RBT Tracker provides a developer-centric lens on the native token’s movement and economic state. Inspect supply breakdowns—total, circulating, and locked—across both mainnet and testnet without exposing live values in documentation. Drill into the ranked list of top holders to understand token concentration and identify key participants. Chart transfer patterns over custom timeframes to identify spikes, high-volume flows, or unusual activity. Finally, explore pledge events to see how RBT is staked for smart contract execution, giving insight into network demand and contract economics.
