# Validator Log Inspection

With Validator Logs, you gain visibility into the consensus machinery behind every transaction. Inspect which validators formed the quorum for a given transaction and review their cryptographic signatures to confirm integrity. Analyze validation event timelines, including vote casting, timeouts, and any slashing triggers. Track individual validator performance metrics—such as success rates and response latencies—to spot underperforming nodes. Correlate these logs with smart contract execution traces to pinpoint validation-related failures or delays.

- Quorum Participation: View which validators signed each transaction and their cryptographic signatures.
- Validation Events: Inspect detailed logs of consensus votes, timeouts, and slashing risks.
- Performance Metrics: Check per‐validator success rates, latencies, and resource utilization.
- Debugging Tools: Correlate validation steps with smart contract execution traces.
