# Validator Performance & Logs

Validators secure consensus and verify transactions on the Rubix Network.  

To inspect validator activity, search for any Transaction ID in the Explorer.  
On the transaction detail page, scroll to **Validator Logs**, where youâ€™ll see:  
- Which validators signed and validated the transaction  
- Cryptographic signatures  
- Consensus participation  

This helps monitor node reliability and performance across the network.
