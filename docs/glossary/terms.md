**RBT (Rubix Token)**
The primary utility token in the Rubix Network, capped at ~51.4 million. Used for transaction validation, validator pledging, smart contract deployment and governance.

**Tokenchain**
A dedicated transaction history bound to a single token (fungible or non-fungible). Each chain records state changes.

**Proof of Pledge(POP)** 
The Rubix consensus model where validators pledge RBT tokens instead of burning compute (PoW) or locking massive stake (PoS). Validators earn proof credits based on their active contribution.

**Quorum or Validator**
A node that participates in transaction validation by pledging RBT tokens. Quorums earn proof credits and help maintain the integrity, fault tolerance, and consensus of the Rubix network.

**Credit**
A unit of validator contribution in Rubix earned by pledging RBT tokens and validating transactions. Accumulated proof credits can be converted into new RBT tokens via mining.

**Decentralized Identity(DID)**
A self-sovereign, cryptographically verifiable identity generated by each Rubix node. Based on ECDSA-P256, DIDs are used to sign transactions and establish trust without central authorities.
