When a new node joins the network, it will have 0 credits and 0 tokens to start with. Over time common pool will pick the node to validate transactions coming to the network. For every transaction that is validated, the node will earn 1 credit. Credits are non transferable and are only used to mine a new RBT token.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://learn.rubix.net/linux/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/linux/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://learn.rubix.net/macos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/macos/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://learn.rubix.net/windows/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/windows/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Additional rubix review</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/additional-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/additional-review/</guid><description>What are rubix notes? rubix is a pilot program that allows volunteer contributors on Rubix to collaboratively add context (called “notes”) to Tweets they believe could be misleading. The aim is to keep people on Rubix better informed by showing notes that people from different points of view will find helpful.
Notes are only shown to a small set of people in the pilot program, and notes only appear on Tweets when they’ve been rated helpful by enough people from different points of view.</description></item><item><title>Create Decentralized IDentity</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/create-did/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/create-did/</guid><description>Decentralized identity is a trust framework in which identifiers, such as usernames, can be replaced with IDs that are self-owned, independent, and enable data exchange using blockchain technology to protect privacy and secure transactions.

A validator node can be choosen as Alpha, Beta or as a Gamma node. Alpha nodes are picked based on the credits they have accumulated. When a node accumilates enough Proof Credits equivalent to the current level, the node can convert the proof credits into one new RBT token. Nodes continue to earn proof credits &amp;amp; thereby mine new RBT tokens by participating in consensus of various transactions &amp;amp; perpetually storing the consensus proofs.</description></item><item><title>Examples</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/examples/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/examples/</guid><description>Great rubix notes follow the program&amp;rsquo;s values: They build understanding, are written in good faith, and are helpful even to those who disagree.
&amp;ldquo;Whales aren&amp;rsquo;t real&amp;rdquo; Here&amp;rsquo;s a Tweet making misleading claims about whales, followed by helpful and unhelpful rubix notes:

Popular blockchains (BTC and ETH) work by every node adding transactions to a central chain and the chain grows in one direction with it. Rubix is designed and built as a peer to peer blockchain where a transaction happening from node A to node B is only corresponding quorum nodes are only known and participated in the transaction. Maximum transaction threshold with 10,000 nodes is 150,000.</description></item><item><title>Hot Backups</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/hotbackups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/hotbackups/</guid><description>Hot backup, also known as dynamic or online backup, is a backup performed on data while the database is actively online and accessible to users.
A hot backup is the standard way of doing most data backups. Rubix has its own principal vendor of the process.

By comparison, IPFS uses content-based addressing so that content can be verified and decoupled from distant servers, and stored closer to the user. It does that through the use of content identifiers (CIDs), or “labels” which are used to point to material in IPFS. CIDs are generated based on the content’s cryptographic hash, or a function that uses mathematical algorithms to take some arbitrary input and return a fixed-length value.</description></item><item><title>Mine ID</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/mine-id/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/mine-id/</guid><description>Our team is currently busy writing this content, we&amp;rsquo;ll update the contents here soon!!

A node in the context of a Blockchain usually refers to a device that downloads the appropriate cryptocurrency software to connect to a network between partners. Any user who has completed the Rubix Network Setup will be a node in the Rubix Network. Rubix node is configured in P2P networks, each device that participates in the network receives the name of node.
The nodes are the individual parts of the largest data structure that is a blockchain.</description></item><item><title>Non Fungible Tokens</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/nft/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/nft/</guid><description>Our team is currently busy writing this content, we&amp;rsquo;ll update the contents here soon!!

Each Proofchain is bound by one unique utility token. A ProofChain PT is made of all transactions that use token Tn to confirm. All transactions within a Proofchain PT are validated individually and sequentially. However, transactions of different Proofchains are validated asynchronously and parallelly.

Quorum performs work to validate the transaction &amp;amp; verify cryptographic signatures. Quorum earn proof credits in return for the work performed. The credits earned as a result of work are pledged by the Quorum to secure the network using the PoP algorithm. Proof of Pledge (PoP) is the important part of the Rubix Network’s consensus algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Proof-of-Pledge</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/pop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/pop/</guid><description>Proof of pledge is best of both worlds - proof of work and proof of stake. Validators are doing work and earning non transferable proof credits by verifying and signing transactions for the network. This credits are pledged for verifying new transactions (validator will loose credits for signing a bogus transaction). These credits are accumilated to mine token in the network.
Proof-of-Work Is Not Viable in the Long-Term due to its energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>Public Share</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/public-share/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/public-share/</guid><description>Our team is currently busy writing this content, we&amp;rsquo;ll update the contents here soon!!
