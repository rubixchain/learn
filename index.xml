Rubix Notes is a pilot program that allows voluntary contributors on Rubix to collaboratively add context (called “notes”) to Tweets they believe could be misleading. The aim is to keep people better informed about Rubix by showing notes that people from different points of view will find helpful.
Notes are only shown to a small set of people in the pilot program, and notes only appear on Tweets when they’ve been rated helpful by enough people from different points of view.</description></item><item><title>Bring your own BlockSpace</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/blockspace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/blockspace/</guid><description>If you are familiar with blockspaces, skip to BlockSpace in Rubix.
What is blockspace? Blockspace is the number of transactions which the blockchain will order before appending to the chain of previous transactions. For example, if max block space is 200KB and an average transaction takes only 1Kb, then the chain may have a room for ~190 transactions in one block. Blockspace is a measure of how busy is the blockchain.</description></item><item><title>Cold Wallet</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/coldwallet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/coldwallet/</guid><description>A cold wallet is a cryptocurrency storage wallet that is not connected to the internet, making it difficult to remotely steal the assets it stores. They keep the user&amp;rsquo;s address and private key safe while allowing them to view their portfolio without compromising their private keys. Cold wallets are the safest way to store your crypto assets. They usually require a bit of knowledge to set up.

By comparison, IPFS uses content-based addressing so that content can be verified and decoupled from distant servers, and stored closer to the user. It does that through the use of content identifiers (CIDs), or “labels” which are used to point to material in IPFS. CIDs are generated based on the content’s cryptographic hash, or a function that uses mathematical algorithms to take some arbitrary input and return a fixed-length value.</description></item><item><title>Key Management</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/keymanagement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/keymanagement/</guid><description>Key management is a set of practices and rules that ensure the safe use of cryptographic keys. Proper management ensures a key stays safe throughout its lifecycle, from generation and use to storing and deletion.
A cryptographic key is a file that contrails a string of letters and numbers that can encrypt and decrypt data when processed by a crypto algorithm. The main goal of key management is to keep these files away from unauthorized users and systems.</description></item><item><title>Mine ID</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/mine-id/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/mine-id/</guid><description>Our team is currently busy writing this content, we&amp;rsquo;ll update the contents here soon!!

In a secret sharing scheme, a set of parties share a common secret. The information about the secret a single party owns is called a secret share. During the splitting of DID, two such shares are created. Secret shares are created from shares using some arithmetic function which can be either linear or non-linear.</description></item><item><title>Node</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/node/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/node/</guid><description>What is node? A node in the context of a Blockchain usually refers to a device that downloads the appropriate cryptocurrency software to connect to a network between partners. Any user who has completed the Rubix Network Setup will be a node in the Rubix Network. Rubix node is configured in P2P networks, each device that participates in the network receives the name of node.

From the first NFT &amp;ldquo;Quantum&amp;rdquo; being created in 2014 to the latest NFT drop by sports giant Adidas and to NFTs that are minted on Rubix Platform.
What is an NFT? NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. The word Fungible means Replaceable, so the meaning of NFT can be interpreted as Non-Replaceable Token, i.e an NFT is unique and each NFT is one of it&amp;rsquo;s kind.</description></item><item><title>Oracle</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/oracle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/oracle/</guid><description>-- Whales are not actually mammals.

It is generated during the DID&amp;rsquo;s Share generation process, and it is 8 times the size of the DID. This Share generation process uses a NLSS based cryptographic solution.
Significance: The Private Share is private/secret for a particular node and only that node has its information. Hence, it is an important parameter during different kinds of authentication scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Proof-of-Pledge</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/pop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/pop/</guid><description>Proof of Pledge (PoP) is a revolutionary protocol designed to bring the bet of both proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS). PoW is essential for security of a decentralized network. However, unlike the highly energy intensive PoW in Bitcoin &amp;amp; Ethereum, Rubix validators are required to work to verify cryptographic proofs of the Proofchains &amp;amp; produce new cryptographic work to sign the transactions. This work of validators in validating the transactions is translated into Proof Credits.</description></item><item><title>Proofchain / Token chain</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/proofchain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/proofchain/</guid><description>The Rubix global state will be made of about 51.4 million Proofchains also called as token chains. Each Proofchain is bound by one unique utility token. A Proofchain PT is made of all transactions that use token Tn to confirm.

Private subnets can be thought as private chains on a public network (b) pooled or common Subnets: Pooled or common subnets can be operated by anyone, composed of several individual nodes or pools of nodes.</description></item><item><title>Terminology</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/terminologies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/terminologies/</guid><description>We are trying to explain some of the terminalogies in simpler terms, thus you will be able to comprehend the terms more easily and swift through the process with ease

A good understanding of smart contracts and tokens is expected before diving deep into this section.
1. Smart Contracts Smart contract is codified business logic written by decentralized app (dApps) developers. Every transaction written to the Rubix ledger( other than RBT transfer) is governed by / output of a Smart Contract. RBT transfer is a native transaction on Rubix. 2. Pledging Principles Any transactions getting written to the ledger would need to have at least one Rubix DID associated with the same.</description></item><item><title>Vision</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/vision/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/vision/</guid><description>Rubix is a peer-to-peer, immutable &amp;amp; truly decentralized blockchain platform that can scale significantly with asynchronous parallelism and support real-world decentralized applications. Rubix deploys a superior consensus mechanism ‘Proof-of-Pledge’ (PoP) — a lightweight algorithm, which reduces carbon emissions significantly. The PoP is highly scalable as it can run on laptops, desktops, and other IoT devices. Its on-chain validation makes the network immutable. The platform also offers instant validation and finality of transactions with a speed of 253.</description></item><item><title>Wallet</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/wallet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/wallet/</guid><description>Web2 Wallet Web2 wallets are centralized wallets where a central third-party maintains ultimate authority over the wallet transactions. Some examples of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges include Binance, Coinbase and LocalBitcoins. Web2 wallets can be related to a bank setup, where a customer trusts the bank to hold his or her money.
Web3 Wallet Web3 wallets are decentralized wallets which have the ability to store the digital assets. This includes everything from fungible to non fungible tokens.</description></item><item><title>What inspired us</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/inspired/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/inspired/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Where to buy Rubix Tokens - RBT</title><link>https://learn.rubix.net/buy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learn.rubix.net/buy/</guid><description>Rubix Tokens are available to purchase in the following exchanges:
