# Proof of Pledge (PoP)

## Proof of Pledge (PoP): A Lightweight and Distributed Validator Consensus Model

Rubix introduces Proof of Pledge (PoP) , a novel, eco-friendly consensus mechanism where every Rubix node is eligible to become a validator (miner) and any node may be selected as a validator through a decentralized selection mechanism.
Unlike traditional Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) that depends on concentrated hash power and excessive energy consumption or large amount of stake to validate, PoP ensures:
- Decentralized and egalitarian mining
- Low carbon footprint and energy efficiency
- Token issuance driven by real participation, not power centralization

| **Feature** | **Proof of Stake (PoS)** | **Proof of Pledge (PoP)** |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Reward Model** | Continuous rewards based on stake size | Credit-based rewards tied to validator participation |
| **Decentralization** | If the staking amount is high, there will be higher chance to become a validator | staking amount is equal, gives equal chance to become validator for all the nodes |
| **Security Risk** | Higher; central validator keys are attack vectors | Lower; no single point of failure; validators are distributed |
| **Stake Lock-in** | Long-term staking often required | Pledge can be revoked if replaced by another validator |
