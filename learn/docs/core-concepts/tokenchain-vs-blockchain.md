# Tokenchain vs Blockchain



| **Tokenchain**                        | **Blockchain**                                                        |

| Tokenchain in Rubix is a dedicated transaction history, bound to a single token. Each Tokenchain acts as a chronological record of state transitions for the token
from its point of origin to its current state.        |   Rubix Blockchain consists of large, but finitely many tokenchains        |
| State of a Tokenchain changes, if a transaction, containing the token, is executed.  | Unlike other blockchains, Rubix doesn't have any global state |
