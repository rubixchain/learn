# Back Up Your Wallet
1. **Store the Mnemonic Phrase:**
- Write it on paper and Store in a secure location.
- store as encrypted file, if you are storing the digital copy of the encrypted file.
- Consider splitting the phrase across multiple locations using Shamir’s
Secret Sharing (SLIP39) for added security.

**Warning:** Do not store your mnemonic digitally unless encrypted.
