# What is Xell Wallet?

Xell is a non-custodial Web3 wallet designed for the Rubix blockchain.It is a secure gateway to the Rubix blockchain. Xell enables you to manage your digital assets, including RBT s (Rubix’s native currency) and TRIE tokens (fungible tokens, FT), interact with decentralized applications (dApps) like TRIE, and access faucet RBTs for testing. Xell uses BIP39 mnemonics for key generation and ECDSA signatures for secure transactions, ensuring robust security and user control in the decentralized Web3 ecosystem. Xell provides a user-friendly interface to manage assets, sign transactions, and interact with dApps, all while prioritizing self-custody and security.
